This GUI allows users to input their GPA, SAT, and ACT and select a state. After submitting the information, their scores are graphed against schools from the selected state, allowing users to visualize how they compare against the average student accepted at different colleges.

This is a personal project created with the goals of furthering my Python skills, learning how to implement a GUI, and learning to build a web scrapper.
